            <h2>Navigating Psychosis</h2>
            <p>Psychosis is a condition that affects the way your brain processes information. It causes you to lose touch with reality. Someone experiencing psychosis may see, hear, or believe things that aren’t real. It's a symptom, not an illness in itself, and it's more common than many people think.</p>
            <p>Psychotic symptoms are often categorized as "positive" or "negative," which can be a bit confusing. It doesn't mean "good" or "bad." Here's a simple breakdown:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <div class="symptom-grid">
                <div>
                    <h3>➕ Positive Symptoms</h3>
                    <p>These are experiences and behaviors that are <strong>added</strong> to a person's normal experience. Think of them as an excess or distortion of normal functions.</p>
                    <div class="pill-container">
                        <span class="pill positive-pill">Hallucinations</span>

                <div>
                    <h3>➖ Negative Symptoms</h3>
                    <p>These refer to abilities or characteristics that are <strong>lost or reduced</strong>. They can be harder to spot and are often mistaken for depression or laziness.</p>

            <h2>Differentiating Disorders</h2>
            <p>Psychotic symptoms can appear in several different conditions. Telling them apart is crucial for proper treatment. Here’s a simplified guide:</p>
            
            <div>
                <h4>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</h4>
                <p>Psychotic symptoms (mainly delusions/paranoia) are directly tied to OCD themes. The person may be convinced their fears are real, but the psychosis is confined to their obsessions. These thoughts are often <strong>ego-dystonic</strong> (unwanted).</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Bipolar Disorders</h4>
                <p>Psychosis is <strong>episodic</strong> and mood-congruent, meaning it only happens during a manic, hypomanic, or depressive episode. The symptoms go away when the mood episode ends.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Schizophrenia Spectrum</h4>
                <p>Characterized by both positive and negative symptoms. The key difference between <strong>Schizophreniform</strong> and <strong>Schizophrenia</strong> is duration: 1-6 months for the former, and 6+ months for the latter. <strong>Schizoaffective Disorder</strong> involves meeting full criteria for a mood disorder plus having at least two weeks of psychosis without any mood symptoms.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>The Dissociative Overlap</h2>
            <p>Symptoms like hearing voices, paranoia, and derealization can also be features of <strong>dissociative disorders</strong> (like DID or OSDD), which can lead to misdiagnosis. In these cases, the experiences often stem from trauma and identity fragmentation. Proper screening is vital using tools like:</p>
            <ul class="info-list">
                <li><strong>Multidimensional Inventory of Dissociation (MID):</strong> A comprehensive assessment for pathological dissociation.</li>
                <li><strong>Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES-II):</strong> A widely used screening questionnaire.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Insight: A Spectrum</h2>
            <p>Insight refers to a person's awareness of their own condition. It's not all or nothing:</p>
            <ul class="info-list">
                <li><strong>Good/Fair Insight:</strong> The person recognizes their experiences are unusual and likely due to their illness.</li>
                <li><strong>Poor Insight:</strong> The person may acknowledge their experiences but attribute them to external factors.</li>
                <li><strong>Delusional Insight:</strong> The person is completely convinced their psychotic beliefs are real and has no awareness of their condition.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Role of Antipsychotics</h2>
            <h4>When are they often NOT the first line?</h4>
            <ul class="info-list">
                <li><strong>Dissociative Disorders:</strong> Trauma-focused therapy is the primary treatment. Antipsychotics can sometimes worsen symptoms.</li>
                <li><strong>Episode-Related Psychosis (e.g., Bipolar):</strong> Mood stabilizers are the foundational long-term treatment, though antipsychotics may be used short-term.</li>
                <li><strong>OCD:</strong> Even with delusional beliefs, the primary treatment is ERP therapy and often SSRIs, not antipsychotics.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Need Help?</h2>
            <p>If you or someone you know is struggling with these symptoms, it's important to seek professional help. It is recommended to see a psychologist and/or psychiatrist who has experience with psychotic disorders for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.</p>
            <p>A good place to start is <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #6a5acd; text-decoration: underline;">Psychology Today</a>, where you can search for in-network providers who specialize in treating psychotic symptoms.</p>
