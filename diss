                <div class="dialogue-box">
                    <p>
                        Welcome, Player. You've encountered <strong>dissociation</strong>. Think of it as a glitch in the connection between your mind and the world. It's a disconnect from your thoughts, feelings, memories, identity, or surroundings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Everyone experiences a mild version of this. It's like your character is on autopilot while driving a familiar route, or getting so lost in a book that you don't hear someone call your name. That's the tutorial level.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It becomes a challenge when this "glitch" happens often, is distressing, and interferes with your main quest: daily life. It's a defense mechanism your brain uses to cope with overwhelming stress or trauma—like a temporary pause screen for your consciousness.

                        When dissociation becomes the main game mechanic and is severe, it might be a <strong>dissociative disorder</strong>. These are the boss battles—complex challenges that require strategy and support to overcome.

                    <h3>Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)</h3>
                    <p>This is characterized by having two or more distinct identity states, or "alters." It's as if there are multiple player characters in one game, but you don't always control who is playing or remember what happened when another was active.</p>

                    <h3>Dissociative Amnesia</h3>
                    <p>This involves an inability to recall important personal information, usually related to a traumatic or stressful event. It's more severe than normal forgetfulness.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes, this includes a "fugue state," a rare side quest where a person travels to a new location with no memory of their past identity.</p>
