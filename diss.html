                    <p>
                        Welcome, Player. You've encountered <strong>dissociation</strong>. Think of it as a glitch in the connection between your mind and the world. It's a disconnect from your thoughts, feelings, memories, identity, or surroundings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Everyone experiences a mild version of this. It's like your character is on autopilot while driving a familiar route, or getting so lost in a book that you don't hear someone call your name. That's the tutorial level.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It becomes a challenge when this "glitch" happens often, is distressing, and interferes with your main quest: daily life. It's a defense mechanism your brain uses to cope with overwhelming stress or trauma—like a temporary pause screen for your consciousness.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <p>
                        It's important to know that almost <strong>everyone</strong> dissociates sometimes. It's a normal human experience that exists on a spectrum.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The most common form is often called <strong>"zoning out"</strong> or daydreaming. Have you ever been in a class or meeting and suddenly realize you missed the last five minutes? Or driven home and not remembered part of the journey? That's dissociation in action!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These minor glitches aren't a sign of a disorder. They're just your brain taking a short break. It only becomes a "boss battle" when the glitches are severe, frequent, and negatively impact your life's quest.

                    <p>This is a category for players with significant dissociative symptoms that don't quite fit another diagnosis. The two most common forms are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>OSDD-1a:</strong> Features identity states that are not as distinct or separate as in DID.</li>
                        <li><strong>OSDD-1b:</strong> Features distinct identity states, but without the significant amnesia between them.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <span class="analogy">Game Analogy: Like playing a co-op game with yourself. For 1a, it's like having different "costume presets" for one character. For 1b, it's like having two separate characters on screen at once (split-screen), and you are aware of what both are doing.</span>

                    <h3>Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)</h3>
                    <p>This is characterized by having two or more distinct identity states, or "alters." It's as if there are multiple player characters in one game, but you don't always control who is playing or remember what happened when another was active.</p>
                    <span class="analogy">Game Analogy: Your controller gets passed between different players, each with their own play style and memories of the game.</span>

                    <p>
                        So why do these "boss battles" exist? They aren't bugs. They are powerful, creative <strong>survival strategies</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        According to the <strong>Theory of Structural Dissociation</strong>, when a player faces overwhelming challenges early in the game (trauma), the personality may not integrate into a single, cohesive character.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Instead, it stays separated into different parts with different jobs. One part, the <strong>Apparently Normal Part (ANP)</strong>, is created to handle the main quest of daily life. Other parts, the <strong>Emotional Parts (EPs)</strong>, are created to hold the difficult memories and feelings from the "boss battles" of the past. This division helps the player survive.

                    <p>For players who want to understand the game's code a bit better, here are some of the deeper mechanics at play.</p>

                <div class="disorder-card">
                    <h3>Memory Glitches (The Amnesia Spectrum)</h3>
                    <p>Amnesia isn't just one thing. It can appear in different ways:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Blackouts:</strong> Total loss of memory for a period. <br><em>Analogy: A corrupted save file that won't load.</em></li>
                        <li><strong>Grey-outs:</strong> Hazy or fuzzy memory. You know something happened, but the details are gone. <br><em>Analogy: A laggy connection to the game server, causing details to drop out.</em></li>
                        <li><strong>Emotional Amnesia:</strong> You remember the facts of an event, but have no emotional connection to it. <br><em>Analogy: You can read the quest log, but the cutscene's audio and music are missing.</em></li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="disorder-card">
                    <h3>Co-Consciousness (Split-Screen Mode)</h3>
                    <p>This is the experience where one part of the self is in control (fronting) while another part is aware and observing in the background. It's the opposite of having amnesia between parts.</p>
                    <span class="analogy">Game Analogy: True split-screen co-op. Player 1 is actively playing, but Player 2 is watching from their corner of the screen, fully aware of what's happening in the game.</span>
